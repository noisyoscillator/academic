<p>We review and extend the formalism introduced by Peliti, that maps a Markov process to a path-integral representation. After developing the mapping, we apply it to some illustrative examples: the simple decay process, the birth-and-death process, and the Malthus-Verhulst process. In the first two cases we show how to obtain the exact probability generating function using the path integral.</p>
