We review and extend the formalism introduced by Peliti, that maps a Markov process to a
path-integral representation. After developing the mapping, we apply it to some illustrative
examples: the simple decay process, the birth-and-death process, and the Malthus-Verhulst
process. In the first two cases we show how to obtain the exact probability generating
function using the path integral $\sum a(x)x^{n}$.

$\sum a(x)x^{n}$

$$\sum a(x)x^{n}$$
is it working? ndjndjndfff
